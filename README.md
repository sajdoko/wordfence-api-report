# Wordfence API Report

Exposes advanced Wordfence security data via a secure REST API endpoint for external monitoring, dashboards, or integrations (e.g., Laravel CRM).

## Description
This plugin provides a REST API endpoint to retrieve detailed security metrics from the Wordfence plugin, including activity reports, top blocked IPs/countries, failed logins, and more. It is designed for integration with external monitoring systems and supports GitHub-based plugin updates.

## Features

- Activity report with:
  - Top blocked IPs (with readable IP addresses)
  - Top blocked countries
  - Top failed login attempts

- API key management from the Wordfence menu
- GitHub-based plugin update support (via Plugin Update Checker)

## Requirements
- WordPress 5.5 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- [Wordfence Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/) plugin must be installed and active
